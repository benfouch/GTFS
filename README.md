General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Static is a flat file format 
for specifying transit(aka bus)schedule information. This is an 
application that can import and export GTFS files and store
the content of the files in a functional and efficient class structure 
within the program. The end users of the application include a transit 
route manager, route planners, riders, mobile applications(via an API), 
Google Transit and others.
